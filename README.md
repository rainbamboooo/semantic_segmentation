I think they predict the road in a relatively high accuracy.

### Parameters
learning_rate = 0.0001
keep_prob = 0.5
batch_size = 16
epochs = 40


### Implementation
All the implementation passed the test.

### Loss
I'm sorry that I failed to print the loss in the .ipynb file. Instead, the loss was printed in the terminal. So I recorded it and drew a graph.
